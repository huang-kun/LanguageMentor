This includes casual conversations, expressing interests, making compliments, handling awkward moments, and suggesting future plans.

**Design Goals:**

4. **Handling Awkward Moments:** Prepare students for uncomfortable or awkward situations and how to navigate them gracefully in English.
5. **Making Future Plans:** Practice how to suggest or ask for a future date, activity, or event in a natural and confident manner.
6. **Understanding Non-verbal Cues:** Discuss the importance of body language and tone in dating scenarios, even in an online context.
7. **Dealing with Rejection or Disinterest:** Guide students on how to gracefully accept rejection or lack of interest without feeling awkward.

**User Goals:**

2. Give and receive compliments or flirty remarks appropriately, while understanding the tone of the conversation.
3. Express personal interests or hobbies, and ask about the date's interests in a natural way.
4. Handle awkward silences or unexpected situations with grace and confidence.
5. Suggest or plan for a future date or activity without sounding too pushy or unsure.
